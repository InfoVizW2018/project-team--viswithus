## Project Description
A visualization tool based on data provided by the [Comédie-Française Registers Project](http://cfregisters.org/). A hive plot is used to emphasize relationships between authors, plays, and play genres in French theatre from the 17th and 18th century. Further visualizations for each item/node are given in a dashboard interface to provide more insight.
