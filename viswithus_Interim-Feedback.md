# VisWithUs Interim Feedback

## Report Feedback

Overall:  B+ (76/100)

### Intro and Motivation  7/10
- The introduction is pretty clear.
- You do not mention enough the motivation for doing the project. Can you expand on this?  Referring more to potential users (as we discussed in your meeting it became clearer).
- The format is not what we suggested, and besides it is very hard to read. Add subsections and smaller width paragraphs as per the suggested style.

### Related Work  16/20
- You've done a lot of exploratory work in that regard, but it feels a bit broad (perhaps because the use case is not clearly defined?)
- It is, however, more images than actual text. Maybe consider explaining how the literature comparatively fits together as opposed to just listing what other people have done and discuss strengths and weaknesses of each one a bit more.

### References
- Referencing style needs work.
- The list is a little thin.

### Approach, Implementation and Technology Choice   28/35
- Requirements feel a bit lacking -- elaborate.
- What is the purpose of exploring the data? The purpose and audience will shape the idioms you choose in order to answer certain questions.
- I don't see how a network graph will help. Maybe defining a specific user-base will help you narrow down the use-case?
- The technology and implementation strategy are pretty well-defined.
- You also list the reasons for picking the particular library.
- But the report needs much more in this regard (demo helped though).

### Proposed Evaluation Steps
- They have a good idea on _how_ to conduct their evaluation, but it's not yet concrete.

### Milestones  8/10
- It's a small milestone list, which does not indicate who is going to do what.
- Please make sure you all contribute to the remainder of the project.


### Risks  5/5
- Maybe listing risks in subsections will make them more readable?
- The risks are realistic, as well as their proposed solutions to mitigate them.
### Wow factor  12/20
- Shows potential, quite innovative in terms of topic.
