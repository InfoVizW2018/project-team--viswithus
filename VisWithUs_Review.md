## Report

### Problem Description and Motivation
- You do a good job of describing the problem, however, your motivation to address this problem could be stronger.

### Related Work
- You do a good job of summarizing the history of related work, however, more discussion on what idioms were used would have helped make a stronger case for your motivation.

### Description of Approach
- Your choices of idioms are mostly justified.
- Your choices of technologies are justified.
- You got expert feedback. Well done!

### Discussion and Future Work
- I would argue that the hive plot (especially with so many data points) suffers from some form of occlusion.
- You have a nice handle on how your project could proceed. I'd be excited to see what comes out of it should you choose to pursue it.
